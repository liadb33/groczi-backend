# **Groczi**  
### *Your Grocery Price Comparison & Optimization App*  

---

## **Project Overview**  
**Groczi** is a grocery shopping optimization app that helps users save both time and money. By comparing grocery prices across nearby supermarkets in real time, Groczi identifies the most cost-effective stores for an entire shopping list. Combining dynamic pricing data, geolocation, and user-centric features, Groczi enhances the shopping experience and bridges the gaps left by existing platforms like Instacart and Flipp.

## **Key Features**  
- **Real-Time Price Comparison**: Compare live prices of grocery items across multiple stores.  
- **Total List Cost Optimization**: Find the lowest total price for your entire shopping list.  
- **Multi-Store Strategy**: Get suggestions for splitting your list across stores for maximum savings.  
- **Location-Based Recommendations**: Navigate to nearby stores offering the best deals using GPS.  
- **User Preferences**: Filter results based on distance, preferred brands, and dietary needs.  
- **Barcode Scanning**: Instantly compare prices by scanning product barcodes.  
- **User Engagement**: Gamified features (rewards, badges) for contributing updated prices.
